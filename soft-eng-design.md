## Target Audience (university student/junior employee/senior employee/open course for self-study etc)

2nd year undergraduate

## Course title:

Software Engineering Design

## General overview of the topic (a few sentences)

This course is about software design. It focusses on building software systems, and addressing common problems using recognised design solutions. We will look at principles of software design, where to apply them, and how they may inform our design choices. We will also look at techniques for ensuring that systems you build behave correctly.

## What capabilities do you want students to exhibit on completion?

Recognise and apply common design patterns.
Apply techniques for removing duplication in code.
Recognise the causes and problems associated with coupling in code.
Develop code using test-driven development.
...

## Ordered backlog of capabilities

Develop code using test-driven development.
Apply techniques for removing duplication in code.
Recognise and apply common design patterns.
Recognise the causes and problems associated with coupling in code.
...

## How could you test for those?

Have students submit their code.
Run code coverage checks on submitted code.
Use human judgement to review the tests and give feedback.
...

## How could students practise and demonstrate those behaviours?

Simple coding exercise - build something from a simple set of requirements using TDD, e.g. RecentlyUsedList.
...

## What information needs to be transmitted?

Principles of test-driven development.
Introduction to tools for a given language (e.g. JUnit).
Demo of the process and rhythm.
